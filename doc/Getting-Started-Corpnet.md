# Getting Started for CorpNet Accessible Servers
## Prerequisites

Before you get started, here are the steps you need to perform for prerequisites:

- Check deployment checklist and install AzureStack HCI OS on your servers to be deployed as AzureStack HCI clusters
- Complete the step 2 (Download the software) & 3 (Install the OS) in this [doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/deploy/download-azure-stack-hci-23h2-software).

<mark>Step 1 (Prepare Active Directory) & 4 (Register with Arc and set up permissions) are covered in the project.</mark>

## Create a repository based on this template

## Connect GitHub Actions and Azure

### Setup [OIDC service principle](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-azure)

Create `terraform` environment in your GitHub repository

<img src="img/CreateRepoEnv.png" alt="createRepoEnv" width="800"/>

Go to [Microsoft Entra Admin Center](https://entra.microsoft.com/#home) to create a service principal. Click **Applications** in the menu bar and then click **App Registrations** to list all the available service princpals. Create a new one for IaC

Add **Federated credential** to the service principal.

Select `Environment` as entity type and input `terraform` to `Based on selection` input box

<img src="img/CreateCredentials.png" alt="CreateCredential" width="800"/>

Add a **secret** into the service principal, then, save it to `servicePrincipalSecret`. We will need it in your IaC repository.

### Grant permissions for the service principal

Grant the following permissions

- Contributor (to create resource group / KeyVault / HCI cluster...)
- Key Vault Secrets Officer (to create secret in Azure KeyVault)
- User Access Administrator (to grant role for Arc-enabled servers)

Go back to your Azure subscription page in Azure portal, select **IAM** -> **Add Role Assignment**, then grant the permissions as follows

<img src="img/assignRole2.png" alt="assignRole2" width="800"/>

<img src="img/SelectMembers.png" alt="assignRole3" width="800"/>

### Setup GitHub repo secrets

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go to your GitHub repository, click repository **Settings** , then go to **Secrets and variables**, select **Actions** to create **New repository secret**

<img src="img/repoSecrets.png" alt="RepoSecrets" width="800"/>

Set up the following secretsï¼š

1. Pipeline secrets:

    - AZURE_CLIENT_ID: The client ID of the service principle in step 1.
    - AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: The subscription ID of the service principle in step 1.
    - AZURE_TENANT_ID: The tenant ID of the service principle in step 1.

2. HCI secrets:

    - domainAdminUser: create a new user name
    - domainAdminPassword: create new password
    - localAdminUser: username when you login to the local host
    - localAdminPassword: password you use to login into the local host
    - deploymentUserName
    - deploymentUserPassword
    - servicePrincipalId
    - servicePrincipalSecret

## Setup Terraform backend

Create a storage account in your Azure subscription (the same subscription as AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID). Create a container in it.

<img src="img/StorageAccount.png" alt="createStorageAccount" width="800"/>

Open `.azure/backendTemplate.tf` in this repository. Replace `\<ResourceGroupName\>`, `\<StorageAccountName\>`, `\<StorageContainerName\>` to the storage account and container you just created. <br/>

Commit `.azure/backendTemplate.tf` by running `git commit` and the run `git push` to push the changes to the remote branch.

## Setup git hooks

Run `git config --local core.hooksPath ./.azure/hooks/`.
This hook will generate the pipeline definition `deploy-infra.yml` when you commit changes to this repository.

## Setup GitHub runners

1. Prepare a Windows machine.
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Add `Git` to path. Run `git --version` to validate.
3. Add `<Git installation root>\usr\bin` to path. The default path is `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin`. 
4. Install [Az CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Run `az --version` to validate installation.
5. Follow the first answer in [PowerShell Remoting - stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18113651/powershell-remoting-policy-does-not-allow-the-delegation-of-user-credentials), finish client side settings to allow remote PowerShell HCI servers from runners.
6. [Register self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners). Make sure that the runner process is running as Administrator.

## Setup Repository

1. Create a branch from `main`.
1. Rename `dev/sample` to `<your location>`. Edit the variables in the `dev/<your location>/main.tf` commit and push.
1. Create a pull request to `main`. After approval, changes will be applied automatically. After the successful deployment, following resources will be created:
    1. A resource group name `<site>-rg`
    1. A KeyVault named `<site>-kv`: Contains secrets that used for deploy
    1. Arc servers that make up the HCI cluster
    1. A storage account used for HCI cloud witness
    1. An HCI cluster name `<site>-cl`
    1. Arc Resource Bridge named `<site>-cl-arcbridge`
    1. Custom location of ARB named `<site>-customLocation`
    1. Two storage paths named `UserStorage1`, `UserStorage2`
1. Add new sites by copy and paste your first site folder to others. Commit and create a pull request for new sites. After the pull request is merged, new sites will be applied.
