# Edge Infrastructure QuickStart Template For Scaling (Preview) 
 $${\color{blue}Accelerate, Automate, and \space Simplify \space the \space IaC \space setup \space using \space your \space familiar \space tools}$$
## Overview

This Quick-Start template simplifies your Infrastructure as Code journey with Azure edge products throughout their lifecycle. It includes a few Terraform modules (**AKS Arc**, **Azure Stack HCI**, **Arc Site Manager** and **Arc extensions**), a scalable hands-on repository structure and the automation tools to streamline the setup of the infrastructure configurations for production scaling.

### What You'll Get

By using this template, you can get all of the followings inside a single PR under your GitHub account

* a scalable and extendible repository structure following the DevOps best practice

### Is This Right for You?

**Yes** if you want to:

* Create an initial site containing AKS Arc, HCI23H2 along with Arc extensions using Terraform
* If you have manually created a PoC site and wish to convert the PoC site settings into Terraform code.
* Replicate the settings from the above site multiple times
* Integrate the above settings with CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
* Automate all of the above scenarios

**No** if you want to:

* Create single AKS Arc or HCI instance using Terraform. Although this template contains the Terraform module for each of them, we are still waiting to officially publish them into public Terraform registry. You are welcome to use this repository for testing and exploration. For production usage, please contact arcIaCSupport@microsoft.com for each module's status.
* Use any other IaC tool such as Bicep or ARM to provision your Azure resources. We are working on our roadmap. Please stay tuned for future releases.

## Getting started

This repository implements AD preparation and Arc connection. Follow the instructions below to set up the rest of the components.

**Steps**: [Getting-Started](./doc/Getting-Started.md)

## Scenario 1: Create your first site from scratch using quick-start template, then scale more sites

### Create your first site from scratch using quick-start template

**Overview**: Ready to deploy your first with AKS Arc on HCI23H2 along with Arc extensions? It's the right place for you.
This scenario provides a quick and efficient way to establish a new site with edge resources with a predefined infrastructure template.

**Steps**: [Create your first site](./doc/Add-first-Site.md)

**Expected outcome**:

* A PR containing Terraform code set up for AKS Arc, HCI, Arc extensions under a single resource group
* A PR containing a pre-defined CI/CD pipeline with the 3 stages: Dev, QA, Prod
* Provisioning action will happen in your side (*merge the PR to `main`*)

### Scale more sites (Private Preview)

**Overview**: Automatically configure scaling settings based on the parameters defined in the previous steps.

**Steps**:

* This feature is currently in **Private Preview**. Before you begin: [Sign up Private Preview](./doc/sign-up-Private-Preview.md)
* Confirm and update the global configurations: If you would like to update the pre-filled values of the global configurations, follow the guidance [Edit-Global-Parameters](./doc/Edit-Global-Parameters.md) to make the change.
* Get the scaling code based on the quick-start template:
    1. Create a new branch from `main` by running `git checkout -b <yourFeatureBranch>`
    2. Run `./az-edge-site-scale generate -c ./.azure/scale.csv -s ./dev/<yourSiteName>` to get the scaling csv file. You can find a spread sheet under `./.azure`. The spread sheet contains all the entries which need customized inputs from you per site.
* [Scale with the automations](./doc/Scale-with-automation.md)

**Expected outcome**:

* A PR with the Terraform code for # of sites, each containing 1 HCI cluster, 1 AKS Arc cluster and the optional monitoring extension and Arc site manager extension.
* A PR containing a pre-defined CI/CD pipeline with the 3 stages: Dev, QA, Prod
* Provisioning action will happen in your side (*merge the PR to `main`*)

## Scenario 2: Convert your PoC site settings into IaC code, then scale (Private Preview)

**Overview**: If you already have a PoC Site modeled within a resource group. This scenario will codify the existing resources and translate them into Terraform modules, then using automations to replicate the custom templates for multiple sites.

**Steps**:

* This feature is currently in **Private Preview**. Before you begin: [Sign up Private Preview](./doc/sign-up-Private-Preview.md)
  > [!NOTE]
  > Resources under the resource group must belong to one single site. Code generation **doesn't** support resource groups containing multiple HCI clusters for now.
* Convert the PoC site into IaC code:

    1. Create a branch from `main` branch by running `git checkout -b <yourFeatureBranch>`
    2. Add a new file `.azure/export.json`. Do not use `base` as the name of the module. It may carry the original contents in your exported module.

    ```json
    [
        {
            "resourceGroup": "/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<yourSampleResourceGroup>",
            "baseModulePath": "./modules/<name-of-the-module>",
            "groupPath": "./dev/<yourSiteName>"
        }
    ]
    ```

    3. Commit and push `.azure/export.json`: `git commit -m <commit message>` and `git push -u origin <yourFeatureBranch>`. A GitHub workflow will be triggered automatically. Create a pull request to `main`.You can find your workflow run as following.
    
    <img src="./doc/img/view_export_workflow_in_action_panel.png" width="800" />
    
    4. After workflow execution, check the generated code.
    
    <img src="./doc/img/view_commit_for_export.png" width="600" />

    * If the workflow runs successfully, the generated code is identical to Azure resources. Please merge the branch ASAP. If there are changes happened after export, the changes will be reverted.
    * If the workflow run fails, you can check `./dev/<yourSiteName>/export-diff` to see what are the changes.

* [Scale with automations](./doc/Scale-with-automation.md)

**Expected outcome**:

* A GitHub repository with Terraform code for # of sites, each containing custom settings for HCI clusters, AKS Arc clusters
* A pre-defined CI/CD pipeline containing 3 stages: Dev, QA, Prod
* Provisioning action will happen in your side (*merge the PR to `main`*)

## Enable Arc extensions for all sites

Any change merged into `main` branch will trigger the update pipeline. If the change fails in early stages, the deployment will be blocked so that this failure will not affect the production sites.
