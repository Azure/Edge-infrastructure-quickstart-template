# Instructions to Use This Repository

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this repository, you need to set up Git hooks. This is essential for ensuring that CICD workflow will be generated during scale. This is a workaround because GitHub disallow workflow to create workflow.

*you need to do it in every machine the first time you cloned  the repo*

### Setting Up Git Hooks

To set up Git hooks, run the following command in your terminal:

```powershell
git config --local core.hooksPath ./.azure/hooks/
```
